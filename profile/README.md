[Deno](https://deno.land) is an awesome project but How we can organize the modules or
packages more easy ? A simple
[import_map.json file](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/import_maps#import-maps)
is the solution but manually can be tedious ... Well we created Dpm **Deno Package
Manager** with this tool you can manage the Deno Modules, Deno Development tools and more!
