## :rocket: The missing Deno Package Manager ðŸ¦•

[Deno](https://deno.land) is an awesome project but How we can organize the
modules or packages more easy ? A simple `deps.ts` is the solution but manually
can be tedious ... Well I created dpm **Deno Package Manager** with this tool
you can manage the deno modules and more.
